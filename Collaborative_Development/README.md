My team has been working very hard on new features for our flag printing program! I wonder how they'll work together?

[Challenge](../Collaborative_Development/collaborative_development.zip)

## Solution

1. Unzip folder.
2. Move to drop-in directory.<br>
   `cd drop-in/`
3. Check the file extension.<br>
   `file guessing_game.sh`
4. Execute the file.<br>
   `./guessing_game.sh`
5. Input numbers.<br>
> [!TIP]
> Input the middle number *(range number / 2 = middle number)*

6. Get the flag.
